Title: Tools for Exploring and Analysing Survey Data in R
Version: 0.0.0.9004
Author: Gregor Dutz
Maintainer: Gregor Dutz <gregor.dutz@gmail.com>
Description: The aim of this package is to provide easy-to-use tools for
    exploring and analysing data from complex surveys. By building on top of the
    packages survey and mitools, it allows to handle complex survey design with 
    replicate weights, as well as multiple imputations, also known as plausible 
    values in the context of assessment studies like PISA or PIAAC. The 
    package's goal is to replicate the functionality of tools like IDBAnalyzer
    or OECD's International Data Explorer (IDB). Please check the README for the
    currently implemented features.
