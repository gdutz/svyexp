This package is in a very early stage of development. Check for implemented features below.

The aim of this package is to provide easy-to-use tools for exploring and analysing data from complex surveys. In building on top of the packages survey and mitools, it allows to handle complex survey design with replicate weights, as well as multiple imputations, also known as plausible values in the context of assessment studies like PISA or PIAAC.

The package's goal is to replicate the functionality of tools like IDBAnalyzer or OECD's International Data Explorer (IDB).
